-- Constant folding
var x: integer is 5 + 3 * 2  -- Should become 11
var y: boolean is 3 < 5 and true  -- Should become true

-- Dead code elimination
routine test() return integer is
    return 42
    print "This should be removed"  -- Dead code
end

-- If simplification
routine check() is
    if true then
        print "Always printed"
    else
        print "Never printed"  -- Should be removed
    end
    
    if false then
        print "Never reached"  -- Should be removed
    end
end

-- Unary optimization
var z: integer is -(-5)  -- Should become 5
var flag: boolean is not false  -- Should become true
